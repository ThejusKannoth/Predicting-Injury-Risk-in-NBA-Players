# Predicting-Injury-Risk-in-NBA-Players
This project uses machine learning to predict injury risk in NBA players based on workload and performance data from 2013â€“2023. By applying models like XGBoost, Random Forest, and SVM with techniques such as SMOTE and PCA, we achieved a top accuracy of 97.97%. The model helps identify high-risk players using metrics like Days Missed, Games Played, and Usage %, supporting data-driven decisions in sports injury prevention.
